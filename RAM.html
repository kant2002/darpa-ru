  </h2>
<div class='left-paragraph'>
      <p>The Restoring Active Memory (RAM) program aims to develop neurotechnology to facilitate the formation and recall of memories in humans living with memory impairments due to traumatic brain injury. To achieve this goal, RAM researchers are developing an implantable neural interface device that can actively record activity from the human brain, use a set of algorithms to decode and encode the neural signatures of declarative memories, and deliver targeted therapeutic stimulation back to the brain to elicit a neural activity state conducive to forming or recalling memories.</p>
      <p>In working toward the goals of the RAM program, a DARPA-funded team at the University of Pennsylvania is leading an effort across eight U.S. clinical centers to collect and analyze intracranial brain recordings. The centers are gathering recordings from human neurosurgical patients performing behavioral tasks designed to assess verbal and spatial memory function—in some cases with concurrent stimulation. The University of Pennsylvania team has made its RAM Phase I human intracranial brain recording and stimulation dataset available to the public.
The following data are available for download:
          <ul>
              <li>Demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity, handedness)</li>
              <li>Individual electrode contact atlas location and coordinates for localization</li>
              <li>Freesurfer files: cortical surface rendering</li>
              <li>Seizure onset zone, interictal spiking, and bad lead information</li>
              <li>Experiment design documents</li>
              <li>Session notes, behavioral event data, and iEEG recording data (split by channel) for the RAM TA1 Phase 1 experiments:
                  <ul>
                      <li>FR1/2: Verbal Free Recall</li>
                      <li>CatFR1/2: Categorized Verbal Free Recall</li>
                      <li>PAL1/2: Verbal Paired Associates Learning</li>
                      <li>YC1/2: Yellow Cab Spatial Navigation</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
