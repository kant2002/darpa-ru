---
    <div width='98%'>
        <p>Welcome to the DARPA Open Catalog, which contains a curated list of DARPA-sponsored software and peer-reviewed publications. DARPA sponsors fundamental and applied research in a variety of areas that may lead to experimental results and reusable technology designed to benefit multiple government domains.</p>
        <p>The DARPA Open Catalog organizes publicly releasable material from DARPA programs. DARPA has an open strategy to help increase the impact of government investments.</p>
        <p>DARPA is interested in building communities around government-funded research. DARPA plans to continue to make available information generated by DARPA programs, including software, publications, data, and experimental results.</p>
